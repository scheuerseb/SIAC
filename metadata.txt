about=The CLEARING HOUSE Spatial Impact Assessment and Classification (SIAC) tool seeks to facilitate a rapid, indicator- and trait-based assessment and classification of urban forests as nature-based solutions (UF-NBS) entities. The SIAC tool is a prototypical implementation of the UF-NBS typology developed in CLEARING HOUSE. The main outputs of the SIAC tool will be a comparable assessment of UF-NBS traits including spatial configuration of tree-based entities such as (tiny) forests, park tree stands, tree alleys or single trees, a consistent classification of UF-NBS with consideration of their composition and spatial-topological relationships, a derivation of indicators, and an estimation of likely benefits of the UF-NBS under scrutiny. SIAC requires the followi9ng dependencies to be installed: geopandas (>=0.13.0), matplotlib (>=3.5.1), momepy (>=0.6.0), networkx (>=3.1), pandas (>=1.1.3), scikit-learn (>=1.3.0), seaborn (>=0.12.2), shapely (>=2.0.1), statsmodels (>=0.14.0), xlsxwriter (>=3.1.2). Please refer to the documentation on how to install these external dependencies.
